# hyperlink-tracker
The Chrome extension will monitor the web pages visited by the user and log all hyperlinks on those sites. Additionally, the extension should be capable of logging hyperlinks in dynamically added content, such as when new tweets or posts are loaded while scrolling on Twitter or Facebook. 


To use, just go to chrome -> more tools -> extensions -> load unpacked
